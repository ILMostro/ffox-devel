Firefox customizations, customized addons, user-scripts

Readamlty
--------
`readamlty.xpi` is a customized [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org) of the 
[readability](https://readability.com) addon.  The customizations I've made to the 
original add-on consist of removing any reference to the "Kindle" button/icon, as 
I have no use for this feature.
